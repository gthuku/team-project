Project by George Thuku, Raveena Wadhwa, and Parth Patel. Our project is a car database designed.
The car database will contain two tables, the first being a car table and the second is the manufacture. The connection will be the manufacture name, and have a one to many relationship. The fields in the car table will be carID, model, year, and manufacture name. The fields in the manufacture table will be manufactur name, manufacture country, and sales representative.
