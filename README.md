Project by George Thuku, Raveena Wadhwa, and Parth Patel. Our project is a car database.
The car database will contain two tables, the first being a car table and the second being the manufacturer table. The connection will be the manufacturer name, and have a one to many relationship. The fields in the car table will be carID, manufacturer name, car type, year, and description. The fields in the manufacturer table will be manufacturer's name, and manufacturer's country.
